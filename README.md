# ATACseeker: A toolkit for ATAC- and scATAC-seq analysis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biobenkj/ATACseeker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biobenkj/ATACseeker)

ATACseeker can work on both bulk ATAC-seq and scATAC-seq data. Prior to analysis with ATACseeker, data need to be aligned and duplicates marked using something like BWA mem and samblaster (to mark duplicates). Once BAMs have been generated, they are good to go for analysis with ATACseeker.
